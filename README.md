# Algorithms
List of self-coded algorithms for further use

## Graph Theory
These algorithms are not ready-to-use. There must be as structure behind.

## MachineLearning
These Algorithms are designed to be the more generic. Some examples of usecase are used.
For now, only one example hic, I think, will further be used to test the different algorithms.

### Algorithms

#### In-development algorithm

* Decision tree

#### Working Algorithm

[No one for now]

### Example

* Titanic -> according to the previous data, will a person live or die.
