# Algorithms
List of self-coded algorithms for further use. 

For the Machine Learning algorithms, I used the free book "A Course in Machine Learning" of Hal DaumÃ© III. 
See website http://ciml.info/ and Github https://github.com/hal3 of the author of the book.

## Graph Theory
These algorithms are not ready-to-use. There must be as structure behind.

## MachineLearning
These Algorithms are designed to be the more generic. Some examples of usecase are used.
For now, only one example hic, I think, will further be used to test the different algorithms.

### Algorithms

#### In-development algorithm
* [In mind]

    * SVM

* [In progress]

    * 

#### Working Algorithm

* Decision Tree
* K-Means

### Example

* Titanic -> according to the previous data, will a person live or die.

### Loss Functions

For now, the only use case I used is Titanic : a Binary Classification.
Therefore, I implemented the loss functions : 
 * Hinge Loss
 * Logistic Loss
